**Secure Account Access**

_As a Doctor, I want to log into the portal with my credentials so that I can access and manage my appointments and professional schedule._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The system validates the entered credentials against the stored Doctor accounts.
2. If successful, the system redirects the Doctor to their main dashboard/calendar view.
3. If validation fails, an appropriate error message is displayed, and access is denied.

**Priority:** High

**Story Points:** 3

**Notes:**
- Authentication mechanism should be consistent with Admin and Patient roles.
