**Secure Login**

_As an Admin, I want to log into the portal with my username and password so that I can securely access and manage the platform._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The system must validate the entered username and password against stored credentials.
2. If credentials are valid, the system redirects the Admin to the main dashboard.
3. If credentials are invalid, the system displays an error message ("Invalid username or password") and keeps the Admin on the login page.

**Priority:** High

**Story Points:** 3

**Notes:**
- Password should be hashed and securely stored.
